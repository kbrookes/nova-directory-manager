# Nova Directory Manager v2.0.38 - Business Category Management

## Release Summary

**Version:** 2.0.38  
**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Type:** Feature Release  
**Priority:** Medium

## ‚ú® What This Release Adds

This release adds the ability for business owners to manage their business categories directly from the frontend editor, eliminating the need for admin access to update business categorization.

### New Features
- **Category Selection Interface**: Business owners can now update their business categories in the frontend editor
- **Checkbox Grid Layout**: Categories displayed in a responsive grid with intuitive checkboxes
- **Current Category Display**: Shows which categories are currently assigned to the business
- **Form Processing**: Handles category updates when the form is submitted
- **Security Features**: Proper nonce verification and user permission checks

## üéØ Why This Feature Matters

Previously, business owners could only update their ACF fields through the frontend editor, but business categories (which are WordPress taxonomies) were not accessible. This meant they had to contact an administrator to change their business categories, creating unnecessary friction and delays.

## ‚úÖ What's New

- **Complete Control**: Business owners can now select/deselect categories as needed
- **Visual Interface**: Intuitive checkbox grid showing all available categories

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Form Organization**: Clear separation between categories and business details
- **Professional Styling**: Modern, responsive design with hover effects
- **Immediate Feedback**: Success messages and redirects after updates
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive grid layout works on all devices

### Security & Validation
- **Permission Checking**: Only business owners can edit their own businesses
- **Nonce Verification**: CSRF protection for form submissions
- **Data Validation**: Proper sanitization of category selections
- **Ownership Verification**: Ensures users can only edit their own businesses
