# Nova Directory Manager v2.0.36 - Critical ACF Field Overload Fix

## Release Summary

**Version:** 2.0.36  
**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Type:** Critical Bug Fix Release  
**Priority:** Emergency

## 🚨 What This Release Fixes

This is a **CRITICAL** fix that resolves an issue where ALL ACF field groups were showing on business and offer post types, creating a confusing admin interface with multiple tabs containing every field group on the site.

### Issues Resolved
- **Field Group Overload**: All field groups were appearing on every post type
- **Admin Interface Confusion**: Multiple tabs showing irrelevant field groups
- **Post Type Mixing**: Business fields appearing on offer posts and vice versa
- **User Experience**: Overwhelming interface with too many field groups

## 🔧 Root Cause

The previous fix (v2.0.35) was too aggressive in loading field groups. The `force_offer_field_groups()` function was adding ALL field groups from JSON files to every post type, instead of filtering them by the specific post type location rules.

## ✅ What's Fixed

### Critical Fixes
- **Field Group Filtering**: Field groups now only appear on their intended post types
- **Location Rule Compliance**: Field groups respect their ACF location rules
- **Post Type Isolation**: Business posts show only business fields, offer posts show only offer fields
- **Admin Interface**: Clean, organized field group display
- **User Experience**: No more overwhelming tabs with all field groups

### Improvements
- **Better Logic**: Added proper filtering based on ACF location rules
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary field group loading
- **Maintainability**: More robust field group assignment logic
- **Error Prevention**: Added safeguards against field group mixing
