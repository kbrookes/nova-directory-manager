# Nova Directory Manager v2.0.37 - Major ACF Field Group Simplification

## Release Summary

**Version:** 2.0.37  
**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Type:** Major Bug Fix & Simplification Release  
**Priority:** High

## üîß What This Release Fixes

This release completely simplifies the ACF field group registration system to eliminate all the conflicts and issues that were occurring with the previous complex approach.

### Issues Resolved
- **ACF Field Group Conflicts**: All conflicts between plugin and manual field group creation eliminated
- **Field Group Overload**: Removed complex hooks that were causing field groups to appear everywhere
- **Registration Conflicts**: Eliminated multiple registration attempts that were causing issues
- **Hook Interference**: Removed problematic filters and reload functions
- **Database Conflicts**: Simplified registration to avoid database interference

## üéØ Root Cause

The previous approach was too complex with multiple hooks and filters that were interfering with each other:
- `force_offer_field_groups()` filter was adding all field groups
- `force_acf_reload_on_offer_screens()` was causing conflicts
- Complex database checking logic was causing issues
- Multiple registration attempts were creating conflicts

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

### Major Simplifications
- **Code Simplicity**: Drastically simplified field group registration logic
- **Reliability**: Single registration point using `acf/init` hook
- **Performance**: Removed complex database checking and memory management
- **Maintainability**: Much cleaner and easier to maintain code

### Technical Improvements
- **Removed**: Complex hooks and filters that were causing conflicts
- **Simplified**: Field group registration to use standard ACF methods
- **Enhanced**: Direct ACF registration without interference
- **Streamlined**: Single registration point instead of multiple attempts

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### Simple Registration
1. **Single Hook**: Uses only `acf/init` hook for registration
2. **Direct Registration**: Field groups are registered directly with ACF
3. **No Interference**: Doesn't interfere with manual field group creation
4. **Clean Logic**: Simple, straightforward registration process

### Benefits
- **No More Conflicts**: Plugin field groups won't interfere with manual ones
- **Reliable**: Much more stable and predictable behavior
- **Fast**: Simplified code runs faster
- **Maintainable**: Easier to debug and maintain
